# Summary of Approach
To ensure keeping to time and making sure of submission, i had to time myself and ignore usage of any additional package like tailwindcss that might delay installations. Made use of legible fonts sizes to limit writing too many media queries and only did where necessary like in Practice Summary card arrangements in mobile and desktop view and major text sizings. I made sure to do away with animations or complex graphics and kept display simple, nice and detailed.

1. Components structure: When building a component, i try to break it down into parts, these parts interact to form the whole, this is the same approach i applied in breaking down the whole UI into several components. The general structure is to have a folder for each component and this folder houses both the stylesheet and functional component respective files for said component e.g for Recommendation component, i created a Recommendation folder and then created a Recommendation.css and Recommendation.tsx in this folder.
2. CSS Choice: As mentioned above, the time to setup tailwindcss or any other UI library might prove expensive and also since the  Dental Practice Summary Card doesn't have that many components or parts, using tailwind might be overdoing it and i decided to stick with regular CSS.
3. To ensure visual consistency and responsiveness, I stuck with using bright colors as background, and darker colors as text color, i also used feint colors for some text with lower hierachy. I made use of the CSS color palette available on VSCode to ultimately pick some colors. For the Status colors, I used the colors advised.

1. To integrate this card into a larger PracticeFuel dashboard, i would:
   - add more details to each card.
   - make it possible to enlarge the charts, i.e more than 6-months view
2. With extra time, i would add the following:
   - little animations, especially on the charts section/components
   - hover/focus animation on each card
   - improve color scheme to beautify the whole page
   - use tailwindcss to convey my expertise in using UI libraries
